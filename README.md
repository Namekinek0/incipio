## Incĭpĭo

Incipio is a CLI English dictionary build in Python. In Latin, Incipio means "I begin, I undertake." I think I couldn't find a better title, since I'm an English student who's learning Python for pure fun and willing to learn new skills, and this project is my first enterprise. At the moment, Incipio is a bare-boned project: users can only input a word and check for its definition from the Webster's Unabridged Dictionary by Project Gutenberg from 2009.

## Future features

* Add or improving commands like: exiting the app(pretty important, I know), comparing two lemmas, adding custom lemmas.
* The current json which contains the dictionary must be improved, since it misses syllabications, part of speech and etymology. Moreover, it returns corrupted text sometimes.
* Add more languages
