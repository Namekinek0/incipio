## IncÄ­pÄ­o

Incipio is a CLI English dictionary written in Python. In Latin, incipio means "I begin, I undertake." I think I couldn't find a better name, since I'm an English graduate who's learning Python for pure fun and willing to learn new skills, and this project is my first enterprise. At the moment, Incipio is a bare-boned project: users can only input a word and check for its definition from the Webster's Unabridged Dictionary released by Project Gutenberg in 2009.  
  
I'm a total beginner in programming, thus any comment or suggestion are welcomed.

## How to use

### Using VSC

Executable to be released ASAP.  
At the moment, simply clone the repository, open the whole folder in the editor, and run main.py.

### Other programs or python IDLE

In theory it's the same as in VSC. But I've never used other editors, sorry. ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

## Future features

* Adding or improving commands like: exiting the app(pretty important, I know), comparing two lemmas, adding custom lemmas.
* The current json which contains the dictionary must be improved, since it misses syllabications, parts of speech and etymologies. Moreover, it returns corrupted text sometimes.
* Building an executable
* Adding more languages
* Switching among different dictionaries
* Using updated dictionaries by API
